        <p>
          <span class="text-black">This is the second item's accordion body</span
          >. It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the
          appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes
          control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via
          CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or
          overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about
          any HTML can go within the
          <span class="text-pink">.accordion-body</span>, though the transition
          does limit overflow.
